# Materiel UI

This repo reflects my implementaiton of the [Net Ninja Material UI tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gjxLvV4VEkZ6H6H4yWuS58).  

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) is a React UI component framework that makes it easy to implement material design in React projects.

In this project, a variety of Material UI react components, other Material UI features (ie. makeStyles, Custom themes) and a couple third parties libraries (JSON Service, React Masonry CSS) are utilized to quickly create a simple modern looking Notes application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this README will be for me to summarize what I learned during the course as a way of bookending the learning and as a resource for ease of future reference. (*I've moved my original README.md content of notes taken during the course [here](./NOTES.md).*)

A quick aside: Some Material UI components I'd like to consider using in future projects not utilized here include: 

* Date / Time
* Select
* Slider
* Stepper (form progress indicator)
* Dialogue
* Snackbar
* Chip (esp. "Chip array" use case)
* Table
* Tooltip
* Transitions

## Getting Started

First, I begin a new repo and commit the Net Ninja Material UI tutorial [starter files](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/material-ui-tut/tree/lesson-1/ "Lesson 1 branch") (lesson 1 branch).

This is basically an empty starter React project with simple React Router implementation between two pages (Create.js, Notes.js) in App.js.  Each page component is basically empty, just returning a div with its name at this point.

I run/add...

* $ npm install
* a .gitignore file
* $ npm install @material-ui/core

And we're ready to begin.
